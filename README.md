# ExifGps - A reader of EXIF GPS values in JPEG photographs

This repository gives Windows users the ability to read values of some of the more exotic EXIF GPS identifiers on a PowerShell Windows host.

It is a utility which is being used in developing a documentation system whereby village network constructors can submit their geotagged photographs for integration with map data in a QGIS layer.

For the time being the use value is mainly produced by giving the project coordinator the ability to inspect that the submitted photographs contain the relevant data.

Limitations: The file open dialog is based on functionality which apparently is available only on Windows hosts.
